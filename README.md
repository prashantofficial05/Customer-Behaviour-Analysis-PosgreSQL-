    Project Overview
    This project is part of a case study that analyzes customer behavior at Danny’s Diner, a small Japanese 
    restaurant serving sushi, curry, and ramen. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into customer 
    preferences, purchasing habits, and potential areas for improvement in the restaurant’s menu and marketing 
    strategies. By leveraging data, the project aims to help Danny make informed business decisions to improve 
    customer satisfaction and boost restaurant performance.

   # Background
    At the start of 2021, Danny opened a cozy diner offering his three favorite Japanese dishes. To keep his 
    restaurant thriving, he needs to better understand his customers’ spending behavior and menu preferences. The 
    diner has gathered some basic data but cannot turn it into actionable insights. With this project, we analyze the 
    data to provide recommendations on expanding the customer loyalty program and refining menu offerings.

  # Problem Statement
    Danny is looking to answer critical questions about his customers:

    1] What are the visiting patterns of the customers?
    2] How much have they spent?
    3] Which menu items are their favorites?
    Using this information, Danny plans to enhance the customer loyalty program and improve the overall dining 
    experience.

  # Key Objectives
    1] Analyze customer visit patterns and spending.
    2] Identify customer favorites on the menu.
    3] Could you provide recommendations to improve menu offerings and the loyalty program?
